# The-Game-Room

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a web-based videogame developers that me on expanding their game, "Draw it or Lose it", to other platforms. The game is currently designed for Android and they wish to explore other consoles or Operating Systems. They gave me free range to explore other systems to develop on, as long as their budget and client traffic weren't affected negatively.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

What I did well while documenting this assigment was the recomendations portion of the document, since I detailed every aceptable option available and provided detailed explanation for my selection.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Having a detailed design document with an extensive breakdown of the client's request, improves development due to the organization and specificity of the requirements. Detailing an exact development request restrict the developer from branching out from the app idea and provides exacly what the customer wants and needs.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The part from my documentation that I would revise, and improve, is the evaluation section. Evaluating a single application for multiple platforms is a challenge on itself, but I believe that with further investigation and tests I can provide a better conclusion regarding these evaluations. In my opinion, this level of involvement is crucial since the client expects a proper evaluation of all choices they could make.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The client is responsable for requesting development, but this is done to offer an experience to the consumer (the user). The user is the responsable for the success of an application, since it is designed for them. For this reason, the user's needs and wants needs to, at least, be considered and designed to ensure that the user has a good experience with it. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached my software designs with the client's wants and needs as my main focus points. I feel that this practice is beneficial and useful for the future, but I also have to consider the user's experience with the application, as explained before. Mixing these two strategies with proper coding and iniciative can improve my skills and, potentially, ensure a successful app.
